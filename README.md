# Pawncore

## Introduction
This project was developed as a prototype implementation for a Pawn Point of Sales System. This prototype was developed alongside an entrepreneurial internship offered by Florida Polytechnic designed to work as a small team in a LEAN startup environment by performing market research and protyping an application.

## Documentation
This project was lightly documented as the scope was to develop the fundamentals of the system from a client perspective to obtain market research. All documents related to the market research and our progress are located in the `docs` directory. 

## Source Codes
All source code can be found in the `src` directory.

## Current Application State
This project is no longer being developed. There are no plans to continue development on this application, as noted in the `docs/project_outcomes.pdf`.
